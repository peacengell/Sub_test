 <p>Glad you could drop in and share some air with us! You've
 passed your underwater navigation skills and
 successfully found your way to the start point - or in
 this case, our home page.</p>
 <h3>About Us</h3>
 <p>Bubble Under is a group of diving enthusiasts based in
 the south-west UK who meet up for diving trips in the
 summer months when the weather is good and the bacon
 rolls are flowing. We arrange weekends away as small
 groups to cut the costs of accommodation and travel and
 to ensure that everyone gets a trustworthy dive
 buddy.</p>
 <p>Although we're based in the south-west, we don't stay on
 our own turf: past diving weekends away have included
 trips up to Scapa Flow in Scotland and to Malta's
 numerous wreck sites.</p>
 <p>When we're not diving, we often meet up in a local pub
 to talk about our recent adventures (any excuse,
 eh?).</p>
 <h3>Contact Us</h3>
 <p>To find out more, contact Club Secretary Bob Dobalina on
 01793 641207 or
 <a href="mailto:bob@bubbleunder.com">email
 bob@bubbleunder.com</a>.</p>
